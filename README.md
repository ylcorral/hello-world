# hello-world
Hi Dr.Day! 
My name is Yngrid some people call me Liz, but you can call me which ever.
I'm a sophmore and a first generation college student in my family.
I'm from peru, I came to U.S.A when I was 1 1/2 years old.
I love cats, I wanted to be a doctor for the longest until I reached college first year and I knew I was making a mistake. 
I thought I was making a mistake and I didn't know what to do then... until I realized I have a connection with computers and creating something, like being able to have something under my control. My father and boyfriend told me to give programming a try.. so I did. It was like a whole new life learning experience because since middle school I was learning medicine and not a single thing about programming, so it was really hard for me. In the end I ended up loving it and it makes me excited when I'm ableâ€‹ to program something and it complies like how I wanted to. So I kept going, I'm enjoying your class so far Dr.Day! You're a great teacher :) Hope to learn new things this semester and in the future.
